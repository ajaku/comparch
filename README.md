Upon submission, all assignments were completed except for the 32 Bit Register File. I was initially under the impression it was just a D Flip Flop Register, but am working on updating it. Attached in the zip file for the assignment are the items completed as of Mar 11, 11:59pm.

As of 12:47 a.m. 3/12/23, added the 32 Bit Register File to the repo.
